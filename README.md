A repository for lab code test written by Matlab.

## Modification:

This version fixed the inaccurate model and add a plot_data function to plot states, input, cost and time. Friction is still not considered in this model.

1. the complementarity constraint for contact is changed according to the correction file. https://github.com/JamesZhaoyh/MPC-test/blob/bigM-v1.3/Some%20Corrections%20to%20the%20Original%20Model.pdf

2. a plot function is added.
